    // 1. Pull request event comes from GitHub
    // 2. Server verifies secret header (X-Hub-Signature-256) from request.
    //    If not, HTTP 400
    // 3. Server checks if project is in allow-list (might not be necessary.)
    //    If not, HTTP 403 - project not supported.
    // 4. Server verifies list of modified files doesn't include:
    //    - `.build.yml`
    //    - `.builds/`
    //    If not, 403 - protected file modified
    // 5. Server verifies pull request has:
    //    - `.build.yml` or
    //    - `.builds/`
    // 6. Infuse build manifests with additional environment variables:
    //    - GITHUB_DELIVERY
    //    - GITHUB_EVENT
    //    - GITHUB_PR_NUMBER
    //    - GITHUB_PR_TITLE
    //    - GITHUB_PR_BODY
    //    - GITHUB_BASE_REPO
    //    - GITHUB_HEAD_REPO
    // 7. Set source to PR branch
    // 8. Submit build to builds.sr.ht using personal access token (temporary measure.)
